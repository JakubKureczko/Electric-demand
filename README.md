The objective of this project was to analyze and forecast electricity demand using historical data combined with weather variables. A significant focus was placed on understanding the patterns and dependencies within the data while addressing challenges such as missing values, irregular timestamps, and limited future weather information. By leveraging advanced time series modeling, the project aimed to provide accurate and interpretable forecasts that capture seasonal and long-term trends.

The dataset consisted of hourly electricity demand spanning over a year (08-2023 to 11-2024) and included weather variables such as temperature, dew point, wind speed, humidity, and visibility. However, the data posed several challenges: substantial missing values, particularly in weather variables, irregularities in timestamps, and anomalous flat demand periods. These issues required careful preprocessing, including using machine learning techniques to predict missing demand values, time-window-based averages for smaller gaps, and replacing flat demand values with modeled estimates.

Through exploratory data analysis, the project revealed strong seasonal patterns in electricity demand. Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly trends were identified, with demand peaking at specific hours of the day and during particular months of the year. Correlation analysis further highlighted the significant influence of temperature on electricity consumption, indicating that weather variables play a critical role in demand forecasting.

Among the various models considered, the Prophet model emerged as the most suitable for this project. Its ability to handle complex seasonalities, missing data, and custom periodic trends made it a robust choice. Prophet was fine-tuned using a grid search approach, incorporating yearly, weekly, daily, and hourly seasonality. The best configuration achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12,858 MW, indicating a high level of accuracy. Visualizations of the forecast and seasonal components demonstrated that the model effectively captured the intricate patterns in the data.

In conclusion, this project successfully forecasted electricity demand by addressing data irregularities, leveraging detailed seasonality analysis, and fine-tuning the Prophet model. The insights gained from this analysis underscore the utility of time series models in understanding and predicting electricity consumption patterns.
